climate zone inlet water temperatures from 
/home/jiml/HotWaterResearch/projects/How Low/draw_patterns/data/DT_Tinlets.csv

This is 365 daily inlet water temperatures by all 16 climate zones.

make_total_drawpattern.R
only made daily summaries as .csv not draw patterns
will need to revise it.

not true
/home/jiml/HotWaterResearch/projects/How Low/draw_patterns/data/DT_total_drawpatterns.Rdata

has data I want. Just read and manipulate that into 5 csv files by number of bedrooms sorted by time of year.

copy 
/home/jiml/HotWaterResearch/projects/How Low/draw_patterns/make_total_drawpattern.R
/home/jiml/HotWaterResearch/projects/How Low/draw_patterns/setup.R
/home/jiml/HotWaterResearch/projects/How Low/draw_patterns/setup_wd.R
to this directory.

set up a new git repository for this small project
see http://happygitwithr.com/
Chapter 18 Existing project, GitHub last

forgot 
    $ git init
    
think I have it now.

got a good start, next is loop through all the bedrooms
there's one small faucet draw during a time change

tried to use write.csv inside the data.table, was slow and couln't figure out how to limit to just the by= rows.

probably should do in dplyr or some R'ish like that. simpler to do inside a loop.
